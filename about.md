# About

Hey, 👋 I'm Jayden. I currently attend Texas A&M, CO '27. Let's go Aggies! 
I graduated from a health professions 🩺 high school, DeBakey High School in Houston, Texas but my interests lie in software 🤖 and cybersecurity ⚔️🛡️.
I enjoy bouldering 🧗‍♂️, working out 🏋️, folding origami 🦢, and playing CTFs 🚩 in my free time.



This is my open book project where I share my ideas, experiences, and knowledge!

## Professional Experience

### BWSI (2023 - present)
During the summer, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory hosts an immersive 4-week program known as BeaverWorks Summer Institute (BWSI), aimed at imparting high school students with advanced technical skills. Within this dynamic environment, I had the privilege of guiding the Embedded Security and Hardware Hacking course, a program I once enjoyed as a student and now returned to as a Teaching Assistant.

*The* highlight of the program was our capstone competition, where teams engaged in a thrilling pursuit to uncover hidden flags within other teams software, employing techniques commonly exploited in practical cybersecurity scenarios. From navigating malicious firmware to deciphering encryption keys and extracting data from flash memory, students encountered and conquered challenges mirroring those encountered by industry professionals.

However, beyond the technical aspects, this experience provided invaluable lessons in pedagogy and empathy. Guiding students through the complexities of embedded systems demanded a shift in perspective, compelling me to break down intricate concepts into digestible, human-intuitive explanations. Moreover, it sharpened my ability to recognize the subtle signs of struggle among students, fostering an environment where they felt supported and encouraged to seek assistance.



## Certifications

### Practical Networking Penetration Tester (PNPT) Certificate

The Practical Network Penetration Tester™ (PNPT) certification is an intermediate-level penetration testing exam experience.  This exam will assess a student’s ability to perform a network penetration test at an professional level.  Students will have five (5) full days to complete the assessment and an additional two (2) days to write a professional report utiziling industry standard tactics, techniques, and procedures with Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), Active Directory exploitation, and network enumeration.

I expect to complete the course and pass the exam in Summer 2024. 

## Technical Projects

### Technical Analysis (July 2023 - present)

> Swing trading is a style of trading that attempts to capture short- to medium-term gains in a stock (or any financial instrument) over a period of a few days to several weeks. Swing traders primarily use **technical analysis** to look for trading opportunities.

I use stochastic analysis with various technical indicators to predict optimal entry and exit times to capture the nature, random market fluctuations. Then I test that strategy across various iterations of historical market data to find the optimal strategy.

This is an example of an exit strategy that utilized predictive KDJ crossovers on historic data.

## Lifestyle Activities 

### Lifting (April 2022 - present)

> Weight training is a common type of strength training for developing the strength, size of skeletal muscles and maintenance of strength. It uses the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction.

Stats:
- Deadlift: 370
- Squat: 355
- Bench: 240

Hardest ascents:

Bouldering: V6, Momentum Silver Street
