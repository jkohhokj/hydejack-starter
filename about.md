# About

Hey, 👋 I'm Jayden. I currently attend Texas A&M, CO '27. Let's go Aggies! 
I graduated from a health professions 🩺 high school, DeBakey High School in Houston, Texas but my interests lie in software 🤖 and cybersecurity ⚔️🛡️.
I enjoy bouldering 🧗‍♂️, working out 🏋️, folding origami 🦢, and playing CTFs 🚩 in my free time.



This is my open book project where I share my ideas, experience, and knowledge!
